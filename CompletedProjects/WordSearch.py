Objective: Create a game of Word Search inspired by the game Word Search
"""
import random


"""
Pseudo code:
    - create game function 
        - word_search(set_of_words)
    - have 10 words that match a category and put them in a list
    - words should be a variety ranging from length 3 to length 6
    - grid of word search should be 6X7
        - 6 horizontally and 7 vertically
    - create an empty 2D list of the dimensions
    
    - create a helper function to help you randomly put the words in the 2D list
    - create a helper function to help populate the remaining empty spaces with 
        random letters of the alphabet
    - display the grid with all the letters in regular white colors
    - create a function that will change the highlights of the letters everytime 
        the user guesses a correct word 
        - 10 different colors
    - create a function that prints the grid correctly
    - display the list of the words after every turn
        - if the word is has been guessed, display it
    - everytime the user guesses the wrong word, say try again
    - everytime the user guesses the correct word, display the grid again with  
        the appropriate highlight on the word they guessed correctly
    - the game ends when all the words have been guessed correctly and it has 
        been displayed (highlighted) correctly on the grid
    - ask the user if they would like to play again
        - if yes, loop the game again, if no, end the program
