Objective: Try your best to replicate Family Feud - Steve Harvey's version
Inspiration: I used to watch some Family Feud with my mom, wasn't something that I would tune in for every day,
it was just cool to guess the questions with my mom. I also enjoyed the celebrity edition with the Warriors Team
